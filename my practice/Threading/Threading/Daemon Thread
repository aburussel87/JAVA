* On the basis of surface of execution, threads can be of two types:
  1. Daemon Threads
  2. User Threads
* When Java program starts, the main thread starts running immediately. We can start a child threads from the main thread. The main
  thread is the last thread to finish execution in normal circumstances, because it has to perform various shutdown operations.
* Daemon threads are intended to be the helper threads which can run in background and are of low priority. For example: GC thread
* So, under normal circumstances, user threads are allowed to terminate once they are done with their execution, however, the daemon
  threads are shutdown by JVM once all the other threads are done with their execution.
