### 2. Link Your Local Folder

Open Terminal (or Git Bash), then:

#### Navigate to your folder:
```bash
cd /path/to/your/folder
Initialize Git (if not already a repo):
git init
Add all files:
git add .
Commit the files:
git commit -m "Initial commit"
3. Connect to GitHub
Add the remote (replace with your repo URL):
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
Push your code:
git push -u origin master
If you get an error with master, try main:
git push -u origin main
âœ… Done!

Your local folder is now uploaded to GitHub. You can continue making changes, committing, and pushing updates from your local machine.
ðŸ“Œ Optional Tips

Add a .gitignore to avoid uploading temporary or build files
